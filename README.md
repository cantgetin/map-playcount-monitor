# Map playcount monitor
Allows you to see the playcount of your [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home) maps and daily increase of it.

Made with NextJS using localstorage to store stuff and a bit of Tailwind for styling.\
Using osu! api to fetch user and beatmap info.\
Utilizing NextJS server-side functions to call osu! API cuz no it has no CORS.
